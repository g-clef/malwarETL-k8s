## installing metallb

This step is optional if you don't expect to expose any services outside the cluster. I do expect that, and have a 
cluster that's run on bare metal at home, so metallb is tailor-made for my use-case. 

The interesting thing is, the kubespray install of metallb was just weird (don't know quite why it wasn't working),
so I'm installing it by hand.

`helm repo add metallb https://metallb.github.io/metallb`

`helm install metallb metallb/metallb -n metallb-system`

`kubectl apply -f addresspool.yaml -n metallb-system`
