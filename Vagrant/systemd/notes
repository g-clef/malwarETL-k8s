These two service files need to be put in /etc/systemd/system.

They are a *NASTY* hack to get systemd to properly start the vagrant VMs. I resorted to this because virtualbox's
autostart script was not actually starting things, and it wasn't clear why. Rather than yak-shave about fixing
vbox's BS, I just did the easy thing & made systemd start them.
