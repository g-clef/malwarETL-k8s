find the lxc profiles that apply to your pods, make sure they're exempted from apparmor controls:
`lxc profile show juju-k8s-kubernetes-master-<>`

It needs to have a section like :
```raw.lxc: |
    lxc.apparmor.profile=unconfined
```
There will be other stuff in the raw.lxc part, that's fine. but if it's missing t he lxc.apparmor command, you'll
need to edit it with
`lxc profile edit juju-k8s-kubernetes-master-<>`, and add that.
