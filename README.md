# malwarETL-k8s
## K8s policies/setup files for malwarETL installation

This is a set of scripts and configurations to install k8s on a local bare-metal repo, which I then run malwarETL on 
top of. 

This has a few advantages: 
  1) kubespray + ansible means that adding/removing/updating nodes is done in a scripted way, rather than manually tweaking nodes.
  2) using kubespray means it's using kubeadm under the hood, we we're still getting the recommended settings for much of the node setup.
